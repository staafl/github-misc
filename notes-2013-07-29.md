Visual Studio - Guide To Power
===
Telerik Academy, 27 July 2013


1. Visual Studio and its Interface
=========================

* tab panes and side panes
    - creating new tab groups - drag window to dock target with dashed line
    - windows in tab panes can be "pinned"

* menu
    - opens dialogues and functions
    - accessed with `Alt+<letter>`
    - pressing `Alt` underlines required letter (it's called "mnemonic")

* tool windows 
    - only one instance of each window
    - can be docked in a tab panel, docked in the side panes or floated
    - can be hidden or set to auto-hide
    - most have a menu - access with `Shift+Alt`
    - several tool windows can be docked in the same side pane
    
* document windows
    - a file opened in an editor
    - can be docked anywhere
    - the same file can be opened many times
    - can be split vertically or horizontally

* docking and floating
    - docked windows - in tab pane or side pane
    - floated windows = normal OS windows - can be maximized, tiled, moved to another monitor...

* controlling windows
    - *everything* in VS can be done with only the keyboard - with hotkeys, the menu or the command window
    - `Alt+Minus` - menu with options - close, close all but this, copy path, auto-hide ...
    - floated windows - `Alt+Space` - move, resize... (works with keyboard!)
    - `Ctrl+F4` - close active document window
    - `Shift+Esc` - close active tool window
    - `Menu -> Windows -> Window`: dialog for closing and activating specific windows 

* navigating windows and menus
    - `Esc` - move from tool window to editor
    - `Ctrl+Q` - "quick launch" - search for menus and options in Visual Studio
    - `Ctrl+Alt+PgDn/Ctrl+Alt+PgUp` - cycle editor windows
    - `Ctrl+Tab` - navigation menu (like Windows `Alt+Tab`)
    - `Alt+F6/Shift+Alt+F6/Alt+F7/Shift+Alt+F7` - cycle tool windows
    - all tool windows have hotkeys: Solution Explorer - `Ctrl+W,Ctrl+S`; Object Browser - `Ctrl+W,Ctrl+J`
    - `Ctrl+Alt+Down` - open documents list (arrow to the right of the tab group)

* hotkeys
    - vary on different machines
    - this guide uses "Visual C# 2005" scheme
    - can be reset using `Menu -> Tools -> Import and Export Settings`
    - can be edited using `Menu -> Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Keyboard`
    - choose command, press hotkey in the box and press "assign"
    - you can also search for "keyboard" in "Quick Launch"
    - to list all currently set hotkeys: use the following command in the Powershell (NuGet) console:
> ```$dte.Commands | ? { $_.Bindings } | % { Write-host $_.LocalizedName ';' $_.Bindings }```
    - most VS hotkeys are "chords" - you press `Ctrl+W`, then `Ctrl+S`
        usually you can also just press `Ctrl+W`, then `S`
    
* quick tips
    - `F4` opens combo boxes - standard on windows
    - `Shift+Alt+Enter` - fullscreen
    - `F2` - standard renaming shortcut in Windows
    - `Alt+Enter` - standard "view properties" shortcut in windows


2. File Navigation and Solution Management
=========================

* navigation window - `Ctrl+,`
    - searches for functions, properties, fields, files, classes, ...
    - treats code objects and files differently
    - use different names for files
    - spaces = AND

* solution explorer
    - tree view of project
    - right click menu has useful options
    - `Ctrl+;` - jump to search
    - "Show All Files"
    - `Shift+Alt` to highlight menu

* navigation bar
    - left side contains classes in current file
    - right side contains members in current class

* go to definition - `F12`
    - useful for inspecting definitions and documentation

* back/next
    - use `Ctrl+Minus` to go back, `Ctrl+Shift+Minus` to go forward
    - like in web browser

* error window
    - `F8/Shift+F8` - cycle errors

* bookmarks
    - mark places in code
    - hotkeys:
        clear bookmarks: `Ctrl+B, C`
        next bookmark: `Ctrl+B, N`
        previous bookmark: `Ctrl+B, P`
        toggle bookmark: `Ctrl+B, T`
        bookmark window: `Ctrl+W, B`

* quick tips
    - jump to line - `Ctrl+G`
    - jump to other side of selection - `Ctrl+K, A`
    - jump to matching brace/quotation mark/angle bracket... - `Ctrl+]`
        - hold `Shift` to select
    - `Ctrl+Up/Down`: scrolling with keyboard

* task list - maintains list of tasks in the project
    - two types: comments and user tasks
    - comments - every comment containing `TODO`, `HACK`, ...
        - keywords can be set in the options
    - user tasks - manually
    - make sure you've checked the right type in the task list window

* command window
    - everything you can do in the IDE you can do from here!
    - use aliases to avoid typing long commands

3. Text Editing
=========================

* editors
    - code
    - XML
    - visual editors
    - binary editor

* auto formatting
    - depends on being able to parse the code
    - also removes whitespace
    - can be done automatically on build
    - has limitations

* `Menu -> Edit -> Advanced`: useful features
    - convert to uppercase/lowercase
    - show whitespace
    - comment/uncomment selection
    - everything has hotkeys

* code snippets
    - `Ctrl+K, X` - insert snippet
    - `Ctrl+K, S` - surround with
    - `Ctrl+K, B` - snippet manager
    - XML files - you can make your own snippets

* quick tips
    - highlight current line - `Ctrl+K, U` (same as uncomment)
    - transpose lines/words/characters - `Alt+Shift+T, Ctrl+Shift+T, Ctrl+T`
    - clipboard ring - `Ctrl+Shift+V`
    - insert above/below - `Ctrl+Enter/Ctrl+Shift+Enter`

* refactoring/smart edit menu
    - organize usings
    - refactor
    - generate stub code
    - `Ctrl+.` to invoke

* Context info/IntelliSense:
    - consider disabling IntelliSense - the popups are distracting
    - `Ctrl+J` - invoke IntelliSense
    - parameters info: `Ctrl+K, P`
    - quick info about highlighted symbol: `Ctrl+K, I`

* search/replace
    - `Ctrl+F` - find
    - `Ctrl+H` - replace
    - `Ctrl+Shift+F/H` - find/replace in files
        - regexes supported
        - can be used from command window
    - `Alt+F12` - "smart" search - finds references to variable/type
    - clever search/replace can save a lot of time

* outlining
    - collapses sections of code
    - collapse to definitions
    - toggle outlining
    - `Ctrl+M,H` - hide selection

* rectangular selection
    - `Alt+Shift+Drag` or `Alt+Shift+Arrow`
    - you can use it to edit a column of text
    - you can paste into rectangular selection to replace several words at once
    - 0-width selection turns into multiple cursors - very useful sometimes

4. Projects, Solutions, Building
=========================

* `.pdb` files - contain your source code and debugging information

* `.csproj` - XML file
    - you can edit it by hand (carefully)
    - downgrading project to earlier version of VS? Try changing the version in the XML

* `.sln` file - just lists the projects and the solution and the current build configuration

* `.csproj.user`, `.suo` - user settings

* msbuild
    - Microsoft's build system
    - invokes compiler, versions files, runs custom tools...
    - can be used from command line
    - msbuild /verbosity:diagnostic - detailed error output
    - you can set each file's "build action" from Solution Explorer: right-click, choose "build action"
    - you can see its output from the "Output window" when building

* quick tips 
    - `Shift+F6` - build only current project (useful when many projects)
    - `Solution properties -> Startup item -> Current selection`

* Preprocessor Directives:
`#if`, `#else`, `#elif`, `#endif`, `#define`, `#undef`, `#warning`, `#error`, `#line`, `#region`, `#endregion`, `#pragma warning`, `#pragma checksum`

5. Advanced debugging
=========================

* "watch"
    - locals - all local variables
    - autos - recently used local variables
    - watch windows - user-defined expressions
    - changed expressions are highlighted in red
    - support formatting/hexadecimal display

* "immediate window"
    - invoke code in the context of the current method
    - very useful for checking out values
    - `$exception` variable is currently active exception

* call stack window
    - shows which method called which
    - useful for complicated situations

* advanced breakpoints - access menu with right click
    - contitional breakpoints
    - hit count
    - action when hit

* exception helper
    - you can use"view detail" to inspect the current exception

* intellitrace
    - allows you to "rewind" the code to figure out what went wrong

6. Misc
=========================

* Object browser - inspect metadata from libraries

* F# console - run F# code interactively (expect C# console!)

* in case of problems with VS
    - try deleting the "ComponentCache" directory
    - try running devenv.exe with the /log parameter and check out the Visual Studio Log
    - google or ask in the forum (attach screenshots!) :-)

* adding files as "links" - from "add existing item", click the arrow next to "Add" and choose "add as link"
    - useful for *simple* sharing of code

* we haven't covered
    - T4 templates - generate code using C# templates!
    - making your own snippets (it's easy)
    - project templates
    - project settings
    - integrated source control and code reviews
    - configuration and settings
    - nuget and package control
    - productivity software - JustCode, etc
    - a lot more...

* other recommendations
    - clipboard ring application - ClipX
        - very, very useful
    - snippet manager - snipman.exe
        - it's something I'm working on - a simple and useful snippet manager
        - will be released by September - watch the Academy forum :-)
    - running short pieces of code - LINQPad
        - no need for a project, no need for using System, class Program, void Main
        - just write code and execute it
